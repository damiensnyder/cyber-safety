        Facial Recognition: Background Information
      </h2>

      <h4>
        Written by Nels Schimek. Published 03/12/2020.
      </h4>

      <p>
        To create facial recognition technology, a neural network is trained on
        a huge amount of facial data to recognize specific features, and forms a
        specific identification of a person based on the features. Below is a
        simplified example of how a neural network is designed, going from an
        image of a face to an identification based on the face.
      </p>

      <div class="mid-article">
        <img src="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/nn_example.png">
        <p class="image-caption">
          Caption for this image.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        A database of known faces is created (driver’s licence, mugshots) for
        the government website or private company. When used live on people,
        the neural network measures the distinguishable features and compares
        these to known database to look for identification matches.
      </p>

      <div class="mid-article">
        <img src="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/facerec-zip/giv-3902ACVhTqLxB5j4/Facial-recognition-inArticle_620.png">

      </div>

      <p>
        However there are some issues that arise from facial recognition
        technology. To get enough data to properly train the neural network,
        many images need to be used and, because of the demographics of the
        field that creates these programs, the data sets often contain
        disproportionately many white males and fewer women and racial
        minorities. As a result, the neural networks are worse at accurately
        identifying these underrepresented groups, creating racial and gender
        biases. Another issue is that glare and people wearing sunglasses can
        make it harder for the
        neural network to recognize the features it is looking for, leading
        to less accurate identification. Neural networks also have difficulties
        with twins. Because facial features can be
        so similar between twins, neural networks may mistakenly identify which
        twin is which. If a person has aged since the photo of them that is in
        the database, the neural network may fail to identify them, and if the
        image quality is poor, the neural network will have a much harder time
        properly identifying matches.

        Case Study: United States
      </h2>

      <h4>
        Written by Fernanda Author. Published 03/12/2020.
      </h4>

      <p>
        After Maryland granted license to people without asking for confirmation
        or proof of citizenship, ICE is using AI technology to run scans on
        license plates to match that with undocumented immigrants. Maryland
        became the first state on the east coast to do so and has issued over
        275,000 licenses since 2013. This use of license search is not new, as
        other states have used such technology but the problem is that ICE
        officials in Maryland are doing so without outside approval
        (e.g. warrants).
      </p>

      <p>
        The use of this targets one of the most vulnerable populations within
        the United States, and there are no regulations to how it can be used.
        It can be seen as a breach of citizens' privacy. It also has different
        implications on different sets of people but ultimately is an example of
        using AI technology without taking into account ethics or morality.
      </p>

      <p>
        AI is being used by different groups of people. Relevant examples
        include police departments and ICE, as well provide the implications of
        such uses on the privacy of the general population within the United
        States. The information data was also taken hold of by hackers recently
        which poses a new problem and possible threat. A problem with Clearview
        AI is also the fact that while it has helped police departments, there
        are a ton of issues as well that provide concerns to the general public.
        These include things such as racial profiling and the fact that the AI
        technology often has issues when confronted with images of people of
        color as it tends to be inaccurate.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a new age of technology and with it comes a whole slew of
        questions regarding ethics and morality when using them. Also questions
        on rules and regulations are in a grey area since there are
        varying perspectives on how to even begin drafting regulations in the
        first place. There is a lot of fear of breach on public anonymity and
        security as well.

        Case Study: Hong Kong

        In June of 2019, China proposed an extradition bill that would allow
        people to be extradited over to mainland China. Believing that the bill
        would enable unjust processing and seizure of political dissidents in
        Hong Kong, demonstrations began, and they continue to escalate to this
        current day. The Hong Kong Protests provide a real life look at how
        cybersecurity technology can be used to abet injustice and privacy
        violations against citizens, creating a cycle of aggression and
        cyberwarfare.
      </p>

        Hong Kong’s Legislative Council denies the use of automated facial
        recognition in their security cameras:
      </p>

      <p>
        “According to information provided by government departments, no
        government department has procured or developed AFR-CCTV systems or
        applied AFR technology in CCTV systems.”
        —<a href="ttps://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201906/05/P2019060500349.htm">Secretary Patrick Nip</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        However, cybersecurity technology is present in many other ways. Hong
        Kong’s government currently makes use of:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>39,071 CCTV Cameras</li>
        <li>An unspecified number of “temporary” CCTV cameras</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/201907/19/P2019071900794_315093_1_1563533298225.pdf">
          50 smart lamps</a> (capable of “industrial grade computer for
          artificial intelligence image processing” and containing a “Radio
          Frequency Identification (RFID) tag”)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These devices were all placed with the intent of maintaining public
        security and preventing crime, however, in light of the protests,
        cybersecurity tech such as the above have turned into weapons rather than
        shields.

        Arrests have been made based on people’s online activity, gathered by
        police through cybersecurity tech, such as in the case of Colin Cheung,
        featured in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/technology/hong-kong-protests-facial-recognition-surveillance.html">
        New York Times</a>. In addition, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1594667/fake-occupy-central-app-targets-activists-smartphones">
        spyware apps</a> aimed at pro-democracy protesters are highly suspected
        to be posing as legitimate apps and have been downloaded by many,
        putting them at risk of privacy breaches and information theft.
      </p>

      <p>
        On both sides, new security technology and cybersecurity tactics are
        being used to aid and abet violence, whether it be against protestors
        through the use of identifying tech that allows for police brutality to
        happen discreetly,  to the doxxing (malicious publication of personal
        identifying information) of law enforcement officers.

        In all, there have been 7,300 total arrests, with most of those arrested
        being adults ranging from 21 to 30 years old. Among those 7,300 people,
        105 of them are
        <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3033775/hong-kong-protests-growing-number-repeat-arrests">
        children aged between 12 and 15 years old</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ongoing Hong Kong Protests prove that the advancement of AI
        technology, if left unchecked, can create human rights issues once an
        organization or government decides to weaponize technology against the
        common people. It is more than just an individual concern. It is world
        wide.
