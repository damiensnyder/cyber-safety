        Facial Recognition: Background Information
      </h2>

      <h4>
        Written by Nels Schimek. Published 03/12/2020.
      </h4>

      <p>
        To create facial recognition technology, a neural network is trained on
        a huge amount of facial data to recognize specific features, and forms a
        specific identification of a person based on the features. Below is a
        simplified example of how a neural network is designed, going from an
        image of a face to an identification based on the face.
      </p>

      <div class="mid-article">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Artificial_neural_network_image_recognition.png">
        <p class="image-caption">
          The structure of an artificial neural network (ANN).
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        A database of known faces is created (driver’s licence, mugshots) for
        the government website or private company. When used live on people,
        the neural network measures the distinguishable features and compares
        these to known database to look for identification matches.
      </p>

      <div class="mid-article">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Face_Recognition_3252983.png">
        <p class="image-caption">
          Facial features identified by an ANN.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        There are certainly security benefits from the technology. Using
        biometric authentication increases one’s personal security, as it is
        much harder for someone to spoof or fake facial data than other forms of
        identification. It makes identity verification much easier and safer, as
        there are not keys or IDs that can be stolen, reducing cases of fraud
        or stolen identity. It would also aid in airport security, and aid law
        enforcement security in their ability to find criminals or suspects
        after a crime.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, there are also significant negative issues that come from this
        technology. Because this technology is often implemented in real time,
        there is the issue of decreased personal privacy when people are in
        public, as they won’t always know if their face is being scanned. This
        issue is even more of a problem considering that most governments are
        still working on policy related to real time facial recognition
        surveillance, so what is acceptable and what is not allowed has not
        really been defined, giving rise to the issue of public surveillance
        without just cause. As a result of all this, there is also a significant
        lack of public knowledge or consent with how this technology and the
        data is collected will be used. In terms of the technology, another
        issue is that to get enough data to train the neural network, systems
        end up being trained on mostly white male data, leading to an increased
        likelihood for women or people of color to be misidentified. The
        technology struggles to differentiate between twins, and as problems
        with misidentification if someone has aged relative to their comparison
        image, or if the image quality is poor, due to factors such as glare,
        blurring, or far distances. Finally, there is the issue of secure data
        storage, as facial information could become a target for
        malicious actors.
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        It is useful to protect your data not only from large collections used
        in AI but also from malicious actors. There are a number of small
        actions that individuals can take to make themselves less vulnerable.
        For password security, the best thing you can do is to use a different
        password for each different site. Remembering all of these can be a tall
        task, so using a service like LastPass, which securely stores all your
        passwords and matches them to the appropriate site, can make this
        process easier and safer. If sites offer 2-factor authentication or
        biometric authentication, those measures are recommended. While it may
        take longer to log in, it is significantly more secure. Be cognizant
        when opening URLs. A secure site will have “https://” at the start.
        A site without this may be insecure, and some sites may try and trick
        users by starting with “http://”, removing the “s” to try and get people
        to click on an insecure site without knowing it. As well, it is good
        practice to never open links or files from unknown sources. For your
        devices, update whenever possible. While it may be annoying, updates to
        security are constantly being rolled out. Make sure reputable
        anti-malware
        software is downloaded and updated. It is also a good idea to keep
        your files backed up in multiple locations, using tools such as Google
        Drive or Dropbox. In
        case of an information breach, if anything happens to your device or
        you need to shut it down, you are much less likely to lose your
        information.

        After Maryland granted license to people without asking for confirmation
        or proof of citizenship, ICE is using AI technology to run scans on
        license plates to match that with undocumented immigrants. Maryland
        became the first state on the east coast to do so and has issued over
        275,000 licenses since 2013. This use of license search is not new, as
        other states have used such technology but the problem is that ICE
        officials in Maryland are doing so without outside approval
        (e.g. warrants).
      </p>

      <p>
        The use of this targets one of the most vulnerable populations within
        the United States, and there are no regulations to how it can be used.
        It can be seen as a breach of citizens' privacy. It also has different
        implications on different sets of people but ultimately is an example of
        using AI technology without taking into account ethics or morality.
      </p>

      <p>
        AI is being used by different groups of people. Relevant examples
        include police departments and ICE, as well provide the implications of
        such uses on the privacy of the general population within the United
        States. The information data was also taken hold of by hackers recently
        which poses a new problem and possible threat. A problem with Clearview
        AI is also the fact that while it has helped police departments, there
        are a ton of issues as well that provide concerns to the general public.
        These include things such as racial profiling and the fact that the AI
        technology often has issues when confronted with images of people of
        color as it tends to be inaccurate.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a new age of technology and with it comes a whole slew of
        questions regarding ethics and morality when using them. Also questions
        on rules and regulations are in a grey area since there are
        varying perspectives on how to even begin drafting regulations in the
        first place. There is a lot of fear of breach on public anonymity and
        security as well.

        In June of 2019, China proposed an extradition bill that would allow
        people to be extradited over to mainland China. Believing that the bill
        would enable unjust processing and seizure of political dissidents in
        Hong Kong, demonstrations began, and they continue to escalate to this
        current day. The Hong Kong Protests provide a real life look at how
        cybersecurity technology can be used to abet injustice and privacy
        violations against citizens, creating a cycle of aggression and
        cyberwarfare.

        Hong Kong’s Legislative Council denies the use of automated facial
        recognition in their security cameras:
      </p>

      <p>
        “According to information provided by government departments, no
        government department has procured or developed AFR-CCTV systems or
        applied AFR technology in CCTV systems.”
        —<a href="ttps://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201906/05/P2019060500349.htm">Secretary Patrick Nip</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        However, cybersecurity technology is present in many other ways. Hong
        Kong’s government currently <a href="https://www.ogcio.gov.hk/tc/our_work/strategies/doc/Summary_of_Devices_and_Functions_on_Smart_Lampposts.pdf">
        makes use of</a>:

        <li>An unspecified number of “temporary” CCTV cameras</li>

        These devices were all placed with the intent of maintaining public
        security and preventing crime, however, in light of the protests,
        cybersecurity tech such as the above have turned into weapons rather than
        shields.

        Arrests have been made based on people’s online activity, gathered by
        police through cybersecurity tech, such as in the case of Colin Cheung,
        featured in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/technology/hong-kong-protests-facial-recognition-surveillance.html">
        New York Times</a>. In addition, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1594667/fake-occupy-central-app-targets-activists-smartphones">
        spyware apps</a> aimed at pro-democracy protesters are highly suspected
        to be posing as legitimate apps and have been downloaded by many,
        putting them at risk of privacy breaches and information theft.

        On both sides, new security technology and cybersecurity tactics are
        being used to aid and abet violence, whether it be against protestors
        through the use of identifying tech that allows for police brutality to
        happen discreetly,  to the doxxing (malicious publication of personal
        identifying information) of law enforcement officers.

        In all, there have been 7,300 total arrests, with most of those arrested
        being adults ranging from 21 to 30 years old. Among those 7,300 people,
        105 of them are

        children aged between 12 and 15 years old</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ongoing Hong Kong Protests prove that the advancement of AI
        technology, if left unchecked, can create human rights issues once an
        organization or government decides to weaponize technology against the
        common people. It is more than just an individual concern. It is
        worldwide.

        Poetry shows the scale of the issue through a single human’s eyes.
        Below is one titled “We Are What We Are Made Of” (July 2019) by Tammy
        Lai-Ming Ho, an associate professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and
        president of PEN Hong Kong. Her poetry on the Hong Kong Protests
        demonstrates a reality for many.
      </p>

      <p>
        The poem is lifted from the Los Angeles Review of Books blog post by
        Andrea Lingenfelter. Inside the poem itself one can find explicit
        references to the start of the protests (June 2019) and the everyday
        imagery found among the streets of Hong Kong (walls "covered in squared
        colours"). While the case study presents the protests from an outside
        perspective focused on the potential abuses of security technology,
        the poem shows the will of actual protesters and their supporters.

      <p>
        Gene Wang: I helped draft designs for the website’s different webpages
        and layouts. In doing this, I made sure there were features that would
        link together the different sections and create consistent cohesion
        based on the feedback I collected during our midterm pitch. I also
        created and set up a slideshow to present the website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nels Schimek: My role was to research cybersecurity and facial
        recognition technology, and write up short articles about related topics
        to publish on the website, with the goal of providing information about
        the technologies to readers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Damien Snyder: I created the code for the final iteration of the website
        and inserted the content pieces into it. I also put the website online
        so others could see it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tiffany Pham: I researched and created the Hong Kong Case Study page
        along with the activist poetics page, also connected to the Hong Kong
        Protests. I did advertising to direct traffic to our website via
        Instagram post.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fernanda Oropeza: For this project I was in charge of doing the U.S.
        case study so that there was a more direct link between the issues that
        are presented and the audience’s life. This provided a more national
        perspective to the student and allowed them to see how this might play
        out and affect different communities here in the U.S. Also I created the
        flyer for the website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yen-Chu Yu: I prototyped the website and tried out if it’s possible to
        put our desired features on the website, so we can see the basic flow
        and design for the website.
